<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![hed screencast][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/credmp/hed)

`hed` allows you to manipulate your hosts file from the command-line. By providing safe and easy commands you can add new hosts and aliases to your environment.

This tool was inspired by my students to whom I teach a Basic Cyber Security class. In this class we utilize [Hack The Box as a learning platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b2Xul3gu_8&t=3592s) and most students struggle with editing the `hosts` file when they get started. To make this easier for them I wrote a tool that gives them a safe means of adding and removing hosts in this file.

The tool is to be used as a regular user, it will elevate privileges when it requires it by calling `sudo` and respawning the process.

### Built With

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Using `cargo`

If you have the rust package manager `cargo` installed you can simply install `hed` by running

```sh
cargo install hed
```

It will pull in the latest version.

#### Manual installation

1. Create your local `bin` directory
   ```sh
   mkdir ~/.local/bin
   ```
2. Download the latest binary release
   ```sh
   wget https://github.com/credmp/hed/releases/latest/download/hed -O ~/.local/bin/hed
   ```
3. Make it executable
   ```sh
   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/hed
   ```
4. Ensure the `bin` directory is in your path
   ```sh
   echo export PATH=\$PATH:~/.local/bin >> ~/.zshrc # if you use zsh
   echo export PATH=\$PATH:~/.local/bin >> ~/.bashrc # if you use bash
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

[![hed screencast][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/credmp/hed)

### View the current hostsfile

`hed show` will color print the current hosts file.

```sh
hed show
```

Output:

```
#                    This is a comment
127.0.0.1	localhost	
::1	localhost	
127.0.1.1	pop-os.localdomain	pop-os
```

### Add a new entry

```sh
hed add example.com 127.1.1.1
```

Will add the following line to the hosts file.

```
127.1.1.1	example.com
```

### Add a subdomain

```sh
hed add demo.example.com
```

Will update the hosts file to add the subdomain to the parent domain as an alias

```
127.1.1.1	example.com	demo.example.com
```

### Remove a hostname

```sh
hed delete demo.example.com
```

If it is the primary `name` , the shortest alias will be chosen as new `name` for the host entry. If there are no aliases, the entire record is deleted.

```sh
hed delete 127.1.1.1
```

Will remove the entire record even if there are many aliases defined.

### Add an alias 

``` sh
hed alias demo.example.com arjenwiersma.nl
```

Add a non-subdomain alias to a hostname. This is useful when a host (ip) has many different hostnames. Instead of adding an entry for every unique top level domain they can be added as aliasses.

### Testing

Use the `--file` parameter to test the features of `hed` on a file that is not your `hosts` file.

```sh
hed --file test.txt add example.com 127.0.0.1
```
